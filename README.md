# Retail-customer-sefmentation-using-RFM-and-k-means
For a small company, the customer base is usually small and individually targetable. But as a business grows it gets nearly impossible to have an intuition about each and every customer. At such a stage, human judgments would not work and the business will have to use a data-driven approach to build a proper strategy.
It is also crucial that they not only focus on attracting new customers but also strategize on customer retention. According to the Pareto principle we can say that 20% of customers contribute to 80% of the total revenue. These 20% are loyal and high valued customers. It is also important to find the customers who are at high risk of churning and address their concerns. At such times it is crucial to find groups of customers with similar attributes and target them accordingly.For this purpose of understanding customer segmentation technique is used. Later marketing campaigns can be designed accordingly.

AIM: This project aims to segment the customers of a retail online store for better understanding of the customer base.  
##### Clustering:
Clustering is the task of dividing data points(here cutomers) into segments such that data points in the same segments are more similar to other data points in the same segment than those in other segments. 
For the purpose of segmentation/ clustering in this project RFM analysis and K-means analysis are used

##### Steps:
Exploring the data and each variable
Clean the data
RFM analysis
Data Preprocessing for clustering
K-means implementation
Performance evaluation
