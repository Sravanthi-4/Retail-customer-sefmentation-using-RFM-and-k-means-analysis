# Retail-customer-sefmentation-using-RFM-and-k-means
This project aims to segment the customers of a retail online store for better marketing techniques. 
For a small company whose customer base is small it is possible to target individually. But as the business grows in size, it gets nearly impossible to have an intuition about each customer. At such time it is crucial to find groups of customers with similar attributes and target them accordingly.For this purpose, companies use the technique of customer segmentation.
